// This File demonstrates how to use components. Please remove this file after you have creating your own first component.

// Components are the primary building blocks of your project, the more you leverage them the better.

// csstyle's focus on components make it a perfect match for Web/Angular/Ember/React components.
// Tip: create a separate file for each component to make them easy to find & edit.

// SCSS Tweak
@include component(button) {
  background: #6BD9ED;
  padding: 15px;

  // Options override the component's default styling.
  @include option(action){
    color: #1F1F1F;
    background: #A7E040;
  }

  // Components are composed of parts â€” child elements of the component that can be styled.
  // Parts are very flexible. They can nest in other parts, react to component options,
  // or even have their own dedicated options. Parts are applied using the component name
  // followed by __ and the part name.
  @include part(icon){
    font-size: 34px;
    position: relative;
    top: 10px;

    @include option(rocket){
      &:before {
        content: "\e600";
      }
    }
  }
}

// HTML
// <a class="button --action">
//   Register Now
//   <span class="button__icon --rocket"></span>
// </a>
